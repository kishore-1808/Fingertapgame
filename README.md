# Tap Battle Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥

A fun two-player Flutter game where players battle by tapping! The screen is split into two halves â€” **Player A (Blue)** and **Player B (Red)**. Each tap expands the playerâ€™s region while shrinking the opponentâ€™s, and the score updates in real-time. The player with more taps dominates the screen!
